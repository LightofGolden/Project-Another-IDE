<h2 align="center"> This is "Project: Another IDE" or shortened, "aIDE", an Integrated Developer Environment/IDE made in Roblox with Roblox's Luau. </h2>

This is **NOT** intended for use, this is a fun solo project with me absolutely challenging myself with random 3AM motivation to make this. However, if you wanna use, you can, i can't limit you.
